Question: If I decide to switch from Team Edward to Team Jacob, how will that affect my rollover minutes?
iTunes just told me I’m the only person to ever download The Knack’s second album.
The downside of fame? I can’t walk out of a nice restaurant without immediately getting harassed and hounded by a waiter holding the bill.
Los Angeles hasn’t changed me. I still put on leather pants one leg at a time.
I wonder if this month’s issue of @MensHealthMag will have any articles about abs.
I heard that @THEHermanCain said the sexual harassment charges are making him more popular than ever. #HeyTwitterNiceRack!
I know how Rick Perry feels. The other day I couldn’t remember the name of the third Police Academy movie.
I can’t believe it’s 11/11/11. Seems like just yesterday it was 11/10/11.

Once Regis retires, I’ll have no more competition for weirdest first name on the air.
On tonight’s show, Cheryl Hines undresses me with her eyes. Then dresses me again. And adds a hat.
In North America yesterday, for a few seconds, the entire internet went down. Or, as it's known in my house, "The Day I Spoke to my Wife."
With all this negative attention on Herman Cain right now, I’ll bet Little Caesar is grabbing boobs like there’s no tomorrow.
Just realized what this means on my NY taxi meter: my cab driver is foreign. http://t.co/m4fBcS1m

Larry King’s retiring after hosting “Larry King Live” for 25 years. Personally, I think hosting anything longer than 7 months is overkill.

Yesterday was the longest day of the year, unless you count the time I interviewed Lance Armstrong.
Only one thing on Earth makes me afraid: When my rostral anterior cingulate cortex fails to dampen hyperactivity in my amygdala.
Happy Father’s Day. After I was born, my father renamed it “Happy ‘Don’t Try to Pin This One on Me’ Day.”
The past 2 months I’ve been on tour and haven’t followed the news.  What’s with all the photos of chocolate pelicans?

There may not be a Smog Alert issued in Los Angeles today, but I am issuing something far worse: a Smug Alert. Celtics will take game 7.
The tour is over. As I stare at the horizon, the wind ruffles my beard gently.
My tour has ended and I'm having trouble adjusting. I just screamed at my wife because she wouldn't let me sign her boob.
Tonight was my last show of the tour. I want to thank my fans for making this such an incredible experience. Next time: more prison gigs.

Favorite movie: "The Parent Trap". Not the Disney one; the one by the guy who did the Saw movies. Ps: They don't make it out of the trap.
Last night's show was awesome. If you want to see me kick Stephen Colbert's ass in a manly dance off, go here: http://teamcoco.com

Please don't tell me how "Lost" ended last night. I'm up to the part where they discover a hatch.
Ben Stiller is having a charity auction, and he's included some of my TV props: http://bit.ly/eBayStiller. They make terrible wedding gifts.

I'm a simple man. I start every day with a cup of joe, the morning paper, and a lavender Pan-Asiatic body scrub from my man-servant, Lobo.
Twitter exploded today! I guess my dream of a world where Twitter runs our stock market, phones, and nuclear defense is still a ways off.
Hey Mom, Happy Mother's Day! Hey Hallmark, screw you!
If it ever says I’m following more than one person, I’ve been hacked. I’m a completely monogamous Twitterer—I only follow Sarah Killen.

On my bunk in the Tour Bus, eating Doritos and watching Team America.  Me happy. http://twitpic.com/1llcrp
I'm in San Jose and I'm going to visit Google.  If you look up 'Google' on Google from Google, you see the face of God.
I'm performing tonight at a dinner theater in Reno. Who says my career is in trouble? http://twitpic.com/1l342b
Through the desert on my way to Reno, I passed an establishment called "Shady Ladies". I think it's either a brothel or a tree nursery.
Hey kids, check me out on '60 Minutes' tonight. Watch for the part of the interview where I start crying and admit to mail fraud.

http://twitpic.com/1ap96p - This is a chord I’ll play on my new tour. It’s a chord only I can make. It blew Slash’s mind.
I’m worried health care has pushed my Tour out of the headlines. I’m also worried my anti-delusion pills are wearing off. Need more pills.
