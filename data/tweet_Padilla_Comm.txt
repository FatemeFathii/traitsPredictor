@CookiePie0402 @goodhealth @prsany Ahh! Thanks for the clarification Beth. Fantastic job tonight. Really appreciated your insights.
Pre-made recipes are no longer relevant to food reporters because they have their own kitchens. #PR #media #foodpr #marketing
Earned #media outlets are their own #content houses - Facebook Live, video, #infographics are frequently developed in-house. @prsany
Chefs and cookbook authors are still important as KOL interviews for #food #media.
Seeing is believing. The modern reader doesn't like reading. They want to see recipes, videos, photos, everything. @linneaviktoria @FIRSTmag
The best story angles are those that will make readers stop and say, um what? @munchies @jaggedlittlehil #pr #marketing #media #content
Simple #PRFails include mixed up names, outlets and info that is the opposite of their audience @PRSANY #PRFail #PR #mediarelations #foodpr
