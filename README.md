# Traits Predictor

## Brief Introduction

This is a simple Python personality predictor. Basically, it will cluster users using Big Five test style classification, and try to group users by the same trait to assign trait scores.

## Features
- Predicting users' personality traits.
- Grouping people by users' personality trait

## Methods

### Data Pre-processing

- Unigram
- Word frequency

### Classification

- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boost
- Multi-layer Perceptron

### Regression

- Lasso 
- SGD 
- KNN
- Multi-layer Perceptron 
- Gradient Boost

## Model Selection

For each trait:
- Classification: model with the highest 5-fold cross score will be selected.
- Regression: model with the lowest 5-fold MSE will be selected.


## Data

Validation user selection is randomly selected from [here](http://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/), and the word feature data is collected from [here](https://github.com/mhbashari/NRC-Persian-Lexicon). For the training data, is collected from [here](http://mypersonality.org/wiki/doku.php?id=download_databases).



## Files
- ```fileProcess.py```: pulling data from twitter given some test usernames.
- ```tweetProcess.py```: data processing of raw data pulled from ```fileProcess.py```
- ```featureExtraction.py```: feature extraction and I/O to better format for NRC word list.
- ```trainProcess.py```: training data process.
	- Using Machine Learning techniques. This training process is aimed to predict traits' category, i.e., predict if user is an openness person.
	- Using regression method to get score predictions for each trait.
- ```trainProcess_1.R```: data subsetting using R.
- ```trainBuild.py```: training data pre-process and associated I/O.
- ```modelRun.py```: model application on validation dataset.

## Limitations and Futher Direction

### Data and Source

1. There is few golden standard dataset public online, therefore the training dataset in V1 is limited. In futher development, we should look for a good resource of golden standard dataset.
2. In first version, only plain text that can be found in NRC word list is considered as training sample. For futher development, emoticon can be treated as an important feature. For example, XD, :D, ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°), (Â´ï½¥Ï‰ï½¥`),ï¼ˆã€€ï¾Ÿ Ð”ï¾Ÿï¼‰, ðŸ˜†, ðŸ™„, can help us to understand the emotion behind the tweet greatly. However, some emoticons can be misleading, for example, this one â†’ ðŸ™‚. *Update*: Found [this](https://github.com/wooorm/emoji-emotion) repo on GitHub, listing the polarity on some emoji.

### Method

1. In V1, the final score for each trait is calculated using weighted mean; a better evaluation method should be implemented in further development. 
2. In V1, single target regression is used to get predicted trait score. In futher development, multiple target regression can be implemented to reduce variance. Moreover, model selection for single target regression can be another way to improvement model. Due to limited training sample, model selection for single target regression is not performed in V1.
3. As mentioned in ```Data and Source```, only plain text that can be found in NRC without Part-of-speech tagging. In futher development, POS can be applied on understanding tweets, to improve classfication and regression performance.

### Output

1. Initially, a star graph, such as player attributes in NBA 2K and FM 17 ([like this one](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/1mCEPr5r.png)), is the final output for this project. However I didn't find a suitable tool to visualize the final score. [d3.js](https://github.com/d3/d3) can be one of the solutions, but it's new to me; needs to take some time to learn it.
