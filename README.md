# Traits Predictor

## Brief Introduction

This is a simple Python personality predictor. Basically, it will cluster users using Big Five test style classification, and try to group users by the same trait to assign trait scores.

## Features
- Predicting users' personality traits.
- Grouping people by users' personality trait

## Methods

### Data Pre-processing

- Unigram
- Word frequency

### Classification

- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Random Forest
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes
- Gradient Boost

### Regression

- Ridge regression
- Lasso regression
- SGD regression
- Random Forest regression
- KNN regression
- Gradient Boosting regression
- Decision Tree regression

## Model Selection

For each trait:
- Classification: model with the highest 10-fold cross validation f1 score will be selected.
- Regression: model with the lowest MSE and MAE will be selected.
- Grouping: taking median as score, if the absolute difference between mean and median is less than 0.1. Median will be assigned to classified test and validation data.


## Data

Validation user selection is randomly selected from [here](http://friendorfollow.com/twitter/most-followers/), and the word feature data is collected from [here](https://github.com/mhbashari/NRC-Persian-Lexicon). For the training data, is collected from [here](http://mypersonality.org/wiki/doku.php?id=download_databases).

	- Using Machine Learning techniques. This training process is aimed to predict traits' category, i.e., predict if user is an openness person.
	- Using regression method to get score predictions for each trait.
	- Grouping scores from same labeled trait in training dataset.
